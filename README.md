# markdownPreviewer

Free Code Camp assignment to develop a previewer of GitHub-flavored markdown with React.

This simple app doesn't need many components. Two components are enough:
1. An `<App />` component that contains all main elements on a page;
2. A `<Previewer />` component as a main feature of the app.

Other: There is a possibility to create additional `<Footer />` or `<Header />` components. 

Here is a [Demo](https://codepen.io/YuliyaU/full/ZrKMjW/) for this app.
